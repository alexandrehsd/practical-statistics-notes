    "*Random sampling* is the process of drawing a set of elements (or individuals) from a larger set (called population) in a random way. Random sampling can be done *with replacement*, where each sampled element returns to the population after being sampled for possible future selection. Or else, it can be done *without replacement*, which implies that the sampled element does not return to the population once selected.\n",

Often, one looks at available data and tries to discern patterns. But are the patterns real? Or are they just the product of data snoopingâ€”that is, extensive hunting through the data until something interesting emerges? There is a saying among statisticians: 'If you torture the data long enough, sooner or later it will confess.'\"\n",
